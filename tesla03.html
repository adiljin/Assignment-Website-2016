                    <p>No one knows who owns this mysterious company, but it has invested a billion dollars in the construction of electric plant and is gaining in its ranks the best minds in the automotive industry. The company is called Faraday Future, it was established last year in California. The name of the company has received in honor of the English scientist Michael Faraday, the founder of the electromagnetic field exercises.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, the Faraday Future employs more than 400 employees, but the staff of the company will exceed five hundred people by the end of the year. Among the people working in the Faraday - a former engineer chassis Tesla Model S, a leading designer of BMW i8, a former Ferrari designer interiors and specialist for batteries of SpaceX Elon Musk. Apart from them in the company of so many former employees of Ford, General Motors, Volvo, Facebook and Google.</p>
                     
                    <p>Nick Sampson, former technical director of the Tesla, was appointed senior vice president of Faraday Future and, apparently, acts as the official company spokesperson. He told reporters that in 2017 his company is going to bring to market a new electric car that will challenge Tesla Model S. To do this, the company will invest one billion dollars in the construction of a plant in California, Nevada, Georgia and Louisiana - to the exact place in the Faraday yet undecided.</p>
                    
                    <p>Despite the fact that the company employs nearly 500 people, no one knows almost nothing about the car, which they develop, except that it will be fully electric. No cruising range on one charge or the maximum speed of the vehicle is not known, but the company has already announced that its electric car battery will have 15% more capacity than the battery Tesla Model S. Thus, we can calculate that the Faraday car can pass at a time about 500 kilometers.</p>
                    
                    <p>As for design, the company's website has a teaser, which brings some thoughts about looking like a BMW X6.</p>
                    
                    <p>The company is not going to stop the production of electric vehicles, and also plans to "explore other aspects of the automotive industry, including unique patterns of ownership and car use, extra content and autonomous driving."</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a very ambitious goal for a company that does not have the product, the team 400-500 people and an unnamed public CEO. Nevertheless Faraday argued that already began to buy materials and parts for their future products. And if the fact that the company refused to name its CEO, just intrigued people the information that Faraday Future is investing a billion dollars in the construction of the plant has generated a lot of rumors.</p>
                    
                    <p>When reporters from the Wall Street Journal asked Sampson, where there was such a sum of money from his obscure company, he simply replied, "The names of our partners - confidential information."</p>
                    
                    <p>One rumor claims that Faraday can be Apple, which wants to hide its latest plans to build an electric vehicle. A large number of former employees of the Tesla, is now working in Faraday, associated with the recent words Elon Musk that Apple luring footage of Tesla.</p>
                    
                    <p>No matter how the rumor about Apple faithful, it seems, at Tesla will soon be the first really serious competitor.</p>
